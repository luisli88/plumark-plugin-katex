# markdown-editor-plugin-katex

A [PluMark](https://github.com/luisli88/PluMark) third-party plugin that renders
```katex ...``` blocks as math using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

Second reference implementation of the [public plugin contract](https://github.com/luisli88/PluMark/tree/main/packages/plugin-sdk),
alongside the bundled Mermaid plugin — installed the same way any third-party plugin is: paste this
repo's URL into PluMark's plugin install dialog.

## Install

In PluMark, open plugin management and paste:

```text
https://github.com/luisli88/markdown-editor-plugin-katex
```

The app resolves the latest published release tag automatically — no branch or version to pick.

## Usage

Insert a `katex` code block and write a LaTeX expression:

````markdown
```katex
c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
```
````

Formula text color follows PluMark's active theme via `PluginThemeContext`, the second
argument the app passes to `render()` (see `PluginThemeContext` in `@plumark/plugin-sdk`).
The `code_block` language selector and the diagram edit mode's live overlay syntax-highlight
`katex` blocks using the grammar this plugin declares via `getSyntaxGrammar()` (see `SyntaxGrammar`
in `@plumark/plugin-sdk`) — resolved once when the plugin loads, not per render.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # produces a single self-contained dist/index.js (ESM)
```

`dist/index.js` is what gets fetched and sandboxed by the app — commit it before tagging a release.

## Known limitation

KaTeX's own webfonts aren't embedded in the bundle (kept simple on purpose — this plugin exists to
validate the installation mechanism, not to ship pixel-perfect math typesetting). Formulas render
correctly structured but fall back to the browser's default math-ish font instead of KaTeX's own.
